Overview of changes in GMAMEUI 0.2.5
====================================

* GMAMEUI now supports MAME 0.127. Fixed SF bug 2076562  (unknown option: -yuvmode) by validating supported MAME options prior to launching ROM

* Modified handling of MAME audit processing to catch ROM errors and properly display invalid ROMs. Samples now shows Not Available samplesets

* Italian translation 100% (thanks Ugo Viti)

* Missing/invalid ROMs now reported properly upon launch

* Main window remembers settings on disabling/enabling filter list, sidebar, toolbar and statusbar on startup

* If no preferences file is available, or values are missing, use default values for the UI

* Load and set joystick value in GUI Prefs dialog

* Set default button on the dialogs to be the Close button

* Added support to launch the GMAMEUI Help manual. This will use gtk_show_uri (if GTK > 2.13 is installed), or revert to libgnome's gnome_url_show. Users who do not wish to compile in libgnome (e.g. XFCE or KDE users) will need to explicitly disable it by compiling with --disable-libgnome, but will not be able to access the manual from within GTK

* Apply patch to allow RPM build (thanks Ugo Viti)

* Code changes
  - Consolidated code to retrieve images from zip files
  - Fix many compilation warnings

Overview of changes in GMAMEUI 0.2.4
====================================

* Fixed segfault when closing the Directories window with no ROM or Sample paths set

* Minor UI changes
  - Emulation can be started by pressing Enter
  - Set minimum column width based on column's title
  - Add samples as a toggle column in Gui Prefs dialog
  - Update gamelist view after Gui Prefs dialog is closed, rather than on restart
  - Ellipsize text columns in filters list and gamelist when size is reduced
  - Remove filter horizontal scrollbar
  - Changing the MAME executable is retained on restart (fixing regression bug)
  - Fix keyboard shortcuts
  - Add support for setting cpanel directory
  - Scroll to the last selected ROM on startup (fixing regression bug)
  - Samples filter now works again (fixing regression bug)

* Playing back input (.inp) files no longer requires user to have selected the matching ROM. GMAMEUI automatically opens the ROM based on the .inp filename

* Recording input files silently records to the .inp directory, creating it if it doesn't exist

* Code refactoring
  - Migrating gamelist to GObject for easier refactoring and maintenance
  - Migrate main window to Glade for UI generation
  - Fix some startup errors/warnings, particularly GTK-Critical ones relating to g_key_file and GError
  - Directories window now instant-apply, removing redundant save code on exit

* Added configure switch --disable-doc to avoid building documentation on non-Gnome systems

Overview of changes in GMAMEUI 0.2.3
====================================

* New GMAMEUI UI Preferences dialog, and preferences handling. Most preferences
are now saved automatically as they changed (instant apply). The gmameui.ini
file format has been changed, and the dirs.ini file will be made obsolete.

* Add support for OpenGL options, and corresponding Options dialog page (SourceForge feature request 1977184)

* Add support for -effect option (e.g. scanlines). Note that this is hard-coded to a set of pre-defined effects, and doesn't distinguish between available/unavailable effects. The effects .png files need to be placed in the artwork directory

* Various bug fixes and code cleanups

* Setup directory and build structure for Help

* New translations:
    Italian translation (Ugo Viti)
    Brazilian translation (Junix)

Overview of changes in GMAMEUI 0.2.2
